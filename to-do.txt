- Add unit tests but on the high levl functions once we have everything readr
- Delete folder tmp_files when we don't want to use eda.R or first_try.R anymore. Por mi (Jorge C.) lo borramos.
- Play around with the spatial and begin/end date end points to see what they do.
- Reorder files to group similar functions into separate R scripts
- Think of prefix for the function to download data. I thought datos_* but brainstorm is needed
- ONLY when we have the definitive name of the pkg and the GH repo is named after it then add the handle to the GET requests.
- TRY MANY DIFFERENT DATASETS TO CHECK WHETHER WE HAVE A WORKING PACKAGE
- Whenever we find datasets that are wrong, let's provide two or three
in the examples section of extract_datos to highlkight that some data might be wrong
and it's not the package's fault.

- Make sure extract_date returns a date object in ISO format
- In the documentation of extract_datos list all fields of the metadata tibble
together with their definition.

- Add the definition of the printed metadata of the obejct. For example, what does Readable mean? The user
doesn't know.

- Specify in docs that languages doesn't mean that the data is in different languages. It means that the
metadata is in different languages. The data could be in the regions language or in spanish.


two possible additions:
- if the end path is a zip file, do we unzip and check for file end paths such as .csv, .xml, ...?
It's not a terrible idea and easy to do.

- If we have that a URL has .csv and .xml end paths, shouldn't we tried to read the .csv first
BUT if it fails (error), shouldn't we continue to read the .xml? Currently we only try to read the first file.

- Should we change the 'API did not return JSON' error message to something more explicit?


- Some files are for example .csv but do not end with .csv. For example: http://datos.gob.es/catalogo/l02000011-casas-consistoriales has that the .csv link is https://apirtod.dipucadiz.es/api/datos/casas_consistoriales.csv&rnd=1853307443
but if you remove the end part and the link is https://apirtod.dipucadiz.es/api/datos/casas_consistoriales.csv you can read it easily.
