- Add unit tests but on the high levl functions once we have everything readr
- Delete folder tmp_files when we don't want to use eda.R or first_try.R anymore. Por mi (Jorge C.) lo borramos.
- Play around with the spatial and begin/end date end points to see what they do.
- Reorder files to group similar functions into separate R scripts
- Think of prefix for the function to download data. I thought datos_* but brainstorm is needed
- ONLY when we have the definitive name of the pkg and the GH repo is named after it then add the handle to the GET requests.
