- Add pkg structure
- Add unit tests but on the high levl functions once we have everything readr
- Fix extract_url_form with extract_url_format("i01100377-residencias-de-mayores-caceres")
- Delete extra files such as eda.R
- Play around with the spatial and begin/end date end points to see what they do.
- Reorder files to group similar functions into separate R scripts
- Think of prefix for the function to download data. I thought datos_* but brainstorm is needed
